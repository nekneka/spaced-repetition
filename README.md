# Spaced Repetition

## What & Why
A tool that will remind you to review what you've learned according to [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) intervals.

I kept forgetting important things. Well, all the things - books I've read, topics I've studied. Then I came across the Spaced repetition concept - that there are specific intervals after which your ability to recall some thing you've learned drops dramatically. If you refresh your memory of the subject just before such points in time, the neuron pathway that you have formed will be strengthened, increasing the probability of you recalling that thing later.

Anki works great for me with Japanese. But I needed a more flexible tool, so I coded it.
